# Jonas-Schmedtmann-Tutorials
The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!
This repository contains the projects developed during Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy. The course provides a comprehensive journey through modern JavaScript, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced concepts, with a focus on real-world applications.

## Course Overview
JavaScript Fundamentals: Learn the core concepts of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures.
DOM Manipulation: Discover how to make your web pages interactive by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
Advanced JavaScript: Dive into advanced topics like closures, the "this" keyword, asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await), and more.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understand OOP principles in JavaScript, including ES6 classes and inheritance.
Modern JavaScript Features: Explore the latest features in JavaScript (ES6+), such as arrow functions, destructuring, and modules.
This repository features the five major projects that were built as part of the course, each designed to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Projects
### 1. Guess-My-Number
Description:
"Guess My Number!" is a simple number guessing game. The player has to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. With each guess, the player is told whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the correct number with as few attempts as possible.

Key Features:

Dynamic DOM manipulation for real-time feedback.
Use of conditional statements and event listeners.
Basic implementation of game logic in JavaScript.

2. Pig-Game
Description:
"Pig Game" is a two-player dice game. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulate their score for that turn. A player can choose to "Hold" their score, adding it to their total score, but if they roll a 1, they lose their accumulated score for that turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

Key Features:

Turn-based game logic with state management.
DOM manipulation to update the score and active player.
Implementation of game rules and conditions.

3. Bankist
Description:
"Bankist" is a minimalist banking application where users can log in, transfer money between accounts, request loans, and close their accounts. The application simulates a real banking system with multiple features for account management.

Key Features:

User authentication and session management.
Array methods for transaction handling (e.g., map, filter, reduce).
Sorting and calculating balance, interest, and loans.
Modern UI/UX design with clean and responsive layouts.

4. Mapty-OOP
Description:
"Mapty" is a workout tracking application that allows users to log running and cycling workouts. The application uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create different workout types. It integrates the Leaflet library for map functionality, allowing users to mark their workout locations.

Key Features:

OOP principles applied in JavaScript.
Integration with the Leaflet library for map-based interactions.
Persistent data storage using local storage.
Responsive UI with real-time updates and data visualization.

5. Forkify
Description:
"Forkify" is a recipe search application that allows users to find and save their favorite recipes. The app fetches data from the Forkify API, providing users with detailed recipe instructions, ingredients, and cooking time. Users can also create and manage their bookmarks for easy access to favorite recipes.

Key Features:

Asynchronous JavaScript with API calls.
Implementation of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
User-friendly interface with dynamic rendering of recipes.
Local storage for bookmark management and persistence.

## Conclusion
This repository showcases the practical applications of the skills and concepts learned throughout the "Complete JavaScript Course 2023" by Jonas Schmedtmann. Each project is designed to reinforce different aspects of JavaScript, from basic DOM manipulation to advanced asynchronous programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the applications, and build upon them for your own projects.
